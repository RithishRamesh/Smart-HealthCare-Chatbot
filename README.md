# Smart-HealthCare-Chatbot
Abstract
In this present world there are various diseases for which treatments and remedies are available abundantly. It is impossible for human to remember all the precautions and remedies to cure the disease. There is no relevant platform that could exhibit all the diseases and their respective remedies. Health professionals are not always available to users on all the time. Hence, the necessity of health care chatbot plays a major role in this current world. In the proposed idea, we have created a HealthCare chatbot with Artificial Intelligence techniques which can process the text input and predict the diseases associated with the symptoms given by the user. The HealthCare chatbot implemented here is a user friendly platform which predicts the probable diseases and the home remedies, we can imply to cure based on the symptoms observed by the user in their knowledge.
